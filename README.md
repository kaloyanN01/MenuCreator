# MenuCreator
C++ program for generating menus with first, second and last meal.
The program gives the user two options either to input a new food or to generate a menu for them. 
If the user chooses to add a new food, then they have to decide whether the food that they want to add will be classified as salad/main dish/dessert.
If the user chooses to generate a menu then the program goes through the three txt files(salad/main dish/dessert). 
Each file contains a list of food choices that were either previously inserted by the user through the program or were inserted directly in the txt files.
The program then chooses at random one line(food) from each file and prints it to the end user in the form of a menu containing one choice for a salad/main dish/dessert
